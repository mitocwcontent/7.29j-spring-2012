Course Description
------------------

This course is the foundation for the study of cellular neurobiology. The primary material focuses on the structure of neurons, including the biophysical properties of excitable cells, synaptic transmission, neurochemistry, neurodevelopment, and integration of information in simple systems and the visual system. The different types of synapses are also covered, from chemical synapses to electrical synapses, known as gap junctions, in the squid giant axon. The problem sets are designed to ground students in the understanding that ionic gradients are the primary power source of neuronal transmission.
